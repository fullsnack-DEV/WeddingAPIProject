      "Situated on the western shore of Lake Como, Villa Balbiano is an awe-inspiring Italian jewel, an exceptional historical palazzo that once belonged to the famous Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio, who built it at the end of 16th century and used it as his main residence. A century later, it was enlarged and embellished by Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini who used the Villa to host a gallant and frivolous society where festivals, banquets and dances followed one another relentlessly. Since then each successive owner only added to the splendor of the villa. Nowadays, Villa Balbiano is the largest private residence on the lake, occupying over 2ha, with extensive sumptuous garden, which was distinguished by the British Society of Garden Designers, outdoor swimming pool, a private pier and a boathouse. Inside, its historic interiors have been filled with finest objets d’art and furniture of past centuries, sourced from Sotheby’s and Christie’s. Spectacular 17th century frescoes painted by the Recchi brothers and Agostino Silva still decorate the walls, untouched by time. ",
